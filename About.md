<h1>About...</h1>

<h3>...this project</h3>
<p>This website was created by student Elise Bargman in Fall of 2019 for SML5202: Computers and Languages, an undergraduate course taught by Professor Martin Barge at Queen Mary University of London. The purpose of the assignment was to create a technology-driven language learning website to demonstrate the skills we learned over the course of the semester. </p>

<h3>...the creator</h3>
<p> My name is Elise, I'm an associate student from the United States studying abroad at Queen Mary for one term. I go to Grinnell College in Iowa (think cornfields and caucuses), but I grew up just north of there in Minneapolis, Minnesota (think Lizzo, hockey, and Lutherans with vaguely Canadian accents). I am a Gender, Women's, and Sexuality Studies major, with a technology studies minor. Outside of my coursework, my main hobbies are theatre, travel, and journaling. After this assignment is completed, I will be taking the entirety of 2020 off from uni in order to volunteer for political campaigns in the United States. <a href="https://hub.qmplus.qmul.ac.uk/view/view.php?t=BlVCoQMytN62pUugWKPY"> Visit my QMplus Hub page</a>
