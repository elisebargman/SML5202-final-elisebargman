<h1>About...</h1>

<h3>...this project</h3>
<p>This website was created by undergraduate student Elise in Fall of 2019 for SML5202: Computers and Languages, a module taught by Professor Martin Barge at Queen Mary University of London. The purpose of this final assignment was to create a technology-driven language learning website to demonstrate the skills we learned over the course of the term/semester. </p>

<h3>...the creator</h3>
<p> My name is Elise Bargman, I'm an associate student from the United States studying abroad at Queen Mary for one term. I go to Grinnell College in Iowa (think cornfields and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_caucuses">caucuses</a>), but I grew up 4 hours north of there in Minneapolis, Minnesota (think Lizzo, hockey, and Lutherans with vaguely Canadian accents). I am a Gender, Women's, and Sexuality Studies major, with a Technology Studies concentration. Outside of my coursework, my main hobbies are theatre, travel, and journaling. After this assignment is completed, I will be taking the entirety of 2020 off from uni in order to volunteer/work for a <a href="https://peteforamerica.com/">political campaign</a> in the U.S.  To see some of my other work for this module, <a href="https://hub.qmplus.qmul.ac.uk/view/view.php?t=BlVCoQMytN62pUugWKPY">visit my QMplus Hub page</a>.
