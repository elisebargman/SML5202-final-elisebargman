    <h2>About this website</h2>
    <p>Minnesota is a state in the Upper Midwest, Great Lakes, and northern regions of the United States. Minnesota was admitted as the 32nd U.S. state on May 11, 1858, created from the eastern half of the Minnesota Territory. The state has many lakes, and is known as the "Land of 10,000 Lakes". Its official motto is L'Ã‰toile du Nord (French: Star of the North).

My name is Elise, I'm an associate student from the United States studying abroad here for one term. I go to Grinnell College in Iowa (think cornfields and caucuses), but I grew up just north of there in Minneapolis, Minnesota (think Lizzo, hockey, and Lutherans with vaguely Canadian accents). I am a Gender, Women's, and Sexuality Studies major, with a technology studies minor. Outside of my coursework, my main hobbies are theatre, travel, and journaling.
