<p>This website is designed as a short, intermediate-level refresher to the Spanish language, with a focus on Latin American dialects. In particular, it is designed for native English speakers who studied Spanish in school, but now need help recalling everyday words and phrases due to a period of disuse. Studies have shown that people who have studied a language in the past tend to lose much of their working knowledge of the language if they don't use the language often enough. However, they are much better positioned to re-learn the language quickly than somebody who has never studied it before. The activities on this site were designed with this in mind, helping users refresh their memory and quickly work their way up from simple vocabulary recall to reading comprehension. This site includes a range of multimedia activities to help you become familiar with Latin American Spanish dialects (see left), recall key vocabulary terms (& easily refer back to them), practice saying numbers, and improve your Spanish reading comprehension skills. On the final page, you'll find a list of seven fun ways to continue on your Spanish learning journey, including media recommendations designed specifically for Spanish language learners, and some helpful tools such as Google Translate. Feel free to jump around the website as you see fit, but activities are generally designed to be completed from top to bottom on a page, and pages are organized from left to right on the navigation bar.</p><p lang="es"><i>Â¡Ahora es el momento de aprender!</i></p>
