My name is Elise, I'm an associate student from the United States studying abroad here for one term. I go to Grinnell College in Iowa (think cornfields and caucuses), but I grew up just north of there in Minneapolis, Minnesota (think Lizzo, hockey, and Lutherans with vaguely Canadian accents). I am a Gender, Women's, and Sexuality Studies major, with a technology studies minor. Outside of my coursework, my main hobbies are theatre, travel, and journaling.
